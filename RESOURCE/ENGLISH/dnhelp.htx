.topic MouseOverview=32
.title Mouse in DN

   You can do almost anything with the mouse.

{Common operations:_}

   Mouse click on an active element makes DN respond in a predefined way.

   Left click on a menu's element opens or executes that item.
   Right click in such case is usually equal to the left click, but if the
menu is Main menu and if it is hidden (Options->Configuration->Interface...->
->Hide menu bar). Here right click is used to operate with windows (they may
be overlayed by an activated Main menu), then the left click is used to
operate the menu itself.

   If you grab the window's top (the double horizontal border line), you
can move the window.

   Mouse click on a number in square brackets or on the brackets themselves
(window's upper left corner) closes the window.

   Mouse click on an arrow in square brackets or on the brackets themselves
(window's upper right corner) makes the window maximized (up arrow) or resizes
it to common size (up-down arrow). Also you can simply double click the
window's top to do that.

   You can resize the window while moving the lower left corner (the single
border line).

   You can also use scroll bar with the mouse.

{Mouse in File manager:_}

   Here specific mouse usage in the File manager is described.

   The main feature is file operations, you can read about them below.

   File tagging is done by right-clicking on a file name.

   Mouse click on a sorting indicator (panel upper left corner) open
the {"Sort by..." menu:SortBy}, as by pressing of the Alt-B hotkey.

   Mouse click on a panel's name (path line) can cause two actions. If you
click on a line before the first backslash or on the first backslash itself,
DN opens Drive selection menu. If you click after the first backslash, the
Directory tree will be opened.

   If you grab the panel separator (the double vertical border line), you can
redistribute the two panels' widths. Note that you currently cannot do that
when one of the panels is hidden.

   If you grab the border of the "Name" column (the single vertical border
line), you can change the width of this column.

   A single click on a drive letter in the drive line changes the drive, a
double click makes DN to change to a root directory of that drive (even if
you are already on that drive).
   Clicking on the square brackets housing the drive line closes or opens the
corresponding panel (the left bracket closes and opens the left panel, while
the right bracket does that for the right panel).


   And now to the file operations

   You can grab files, move and drop them, causing coping, moving or
deleting files. The main rule of grabbing is: what you see is what you grab.

   You can grab either one file (over which the cursor is located), tagged
files, or all files (including subdirs).

One file can be grabbed:
  - from the lines "File information" and "LFN" in the footer
  - as an untagged name from file panel.

Tagged files can be grabbed:
  - from the line "Selected files" (in the footer and divider)
  - from the line of the brief info about selected files on the divider (left
part)
  - as a tagged name in the file panel.

All files can be grabbed:
  - from the line "Directory info" (in the footer and divider)
  - from the line of the brief info about directory on the divider (right
part).

   You can also grab files from the panels "Archive" and "List" ("Temp:",
"Search", and "Branch").

   It is also important where you drop (release) files.
   You can drop file on any file panel, panel's name (path line), drive line,
and in the trashcan. The main rule is: where you drop is where you go.

   Files will be copied in the current directory (it's name and path are
displayed at the upper line of the panel's frame border) if you drop:
  - on its path in the frame border
  - on an empty line or a line with filename (not directory name).

   If you drop files on a line with a subdirectory name, they will be copied
into that subdirectory.

   If you drop files on "..", they will be copied into the parent directory of
the current directory.

   When you drop files on a drive letter in the drive line, they will be copied
into the current direcory of that drive. Be careful! If copy confirmation is
turned off and you do not know exactly which directory is "current" on the
drive, the files may be copied to a wrong place!

   When you drop files in a trashcan, they will be deleted.

   File operations will be canceled if you drop files on all other elements
not listed above (for example, when you drop files on the separator between
the panels).

   You can hold Ctrl or Shift while releasing files. If you do, the files will
be moved, not copied. So you can disable confirmation dialog. However, when
you drop files onto a trashcan, the keys are ignored.

   When you drop files onto the "Archive" panel, they will be copied to the
archive.

   When you drop files onto the "Temp:" panel, confirmation dialogs will not
be displayed.

   No action is taken if files are dropped onto "Search" and "Branch".

.title File Manager

The File Manager is the main Navigator window for working with files.
With its help the majority of the file-operations can be performed in
Navigator. The File Manager window is created by choosing Manager|New
from the menubar.
After this, Navigator asks you the drive letter, with which you want to
work, and after you have chosen one, you will see the window with two
file panels.
You can set file panel options by selecting them from the Manager
menu.

The various items of the File Manager window are:
  - {File panel:FilePanel} - Main panel of the File Manager
  - {Directory tree:DirTree}
  - {Information panel:_}
  - {Quick view panel:_}
  - {Temp and Find disk :TempList}

It looks like this:

.title Work with windows

Navigator is a multi-windowed environment, therefore many unexperienced
users may have some difficulties with working with Navigator.
The other users can simply ignore multi-windowed interface, thus
losing the set of convinient opportunities and time.
Besides, the fact that this multi-windowed system is easy and pleasant,
all windows have the same 'appearance' ({"Types of windows":WindowsType},
so you can learn how to work with Navigator quickly. You can switch
between windows using the mouse or commands {Window|Next:_} and {Window|Previous:_}
(all window-manipulating commands have hotkeys).
The window can be closed by the command Window|Close. With help of
{Window|Zoom:_} command it is possible to maximize the window to the size of whole
screen, as well as to return it to previous size.

The list of currently opened windows, is available with {Window|List:_}.

The size and location of a window can be changed with help of a mouse, or
through the command {Window|Size/Move:_}. When that command is chosen,
moving the window is possible with the arrows     , while changing
of its size can be done with the same arrows, together with <Shift>.

The user can re-arrange the windows on the screen choosing "cascade"
({Window|Cascade:_}) or "tile" ({Window|Tile:_}).

; /portions by Deleter/ 07.02.2003

Navigator allows you to delete the files and directories, which are not
empty. This is possible with the command File|Delete.

When trying to erase a non-empty directory Navigator will prompt you
about that:

 ÉÍ[þ]ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ Confirm ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ»

If you simply "automatically" press ENTER, nothing will take place.

In case you are erasing several not empty directories and You are
sure, that want to erase them, you can press "All", and the
confirmation will not be repeated.

Note that you can switch any confirmations of in Options|Configuration|Confirmations
dialog box. We do not reccomend it, unless are pretty sure that you will not
press erase hotkey accidently...


.topic SplitFiles=26
.title Split file to multiple volumes

Dos Navigator can split very large files to several parts a-la DOS Backup.
The main difference between backup and DN-split is that DN does not erase
the contents of the disk, but it only uses free disk space. To split or
Combine a file choose the command File|Split/Combine.

While splitting a file, DN is creating files with extensions ".d??",
where ?? represents the number of the volume. When combining these
files, Navigator distinguishes created volumes using extensions
and internal format.

 WARNING: Files, splitted on multiple volumes with Navigator can
          only be restored by Navigator! If you don't want to
          use DN for merging volumes you should use `Binary
          splitting only' option in Spli dialog box.

.title Copying/moving of files
; /portions by Deleter/ 07.02.2003

Navigator allows to copy both files and directories with its contents.
This can be done with the command File|Copy, when a file panel of
File Manager is active.

Moving of files and directories is done by the command File|{Rename/Move:RenameMove}.
It is executed within the limits of one disk, as from disk on disk.

When copying, Navigator can use system 'copy' function if
`Advanced copy' option is switched on in System Setup dialog box.

 See also {"Copying dialog box":CopyDialog}

.topic CopyDialog=30
.title Copy dialog box


   Fill the input line at the top of dialog with path and/or
   filemask, to which the given file(s) will be copied.
   Standard wildcards are allowed, with two additional
   substitution symbols:

   "<" character in the destination mask means that the
       corresponding source name character is to be skipped

   ">" character in the destination mask means that the next
       character is to be inserted into the name instead
       of replacing existing characters

   The possible options for copying:

    "Overwrite all existing files" - overwrite
    already existing files without requests,
    speeds up the copying process, as does not
    check the existence of a created file.

    "Append to all existing files" - adding the
    contents of a copied file to an already
    existing file without request. If a group
    of files is copied, it is necessary to take
    care about that, so the files are in the
    right order.

    "Ask for overwrite" - Navigator will ask you
    if you want to overwrite an already existing
    file with the file to be copied.
    (on by default)

    "Skip all existing files" - skip already
    existing files without requests

    "Refresh old files" - overwrite already
    existing files only if they older then
    files to be copied

    "Check free disk space" - if you enable this
    option, Navigator will check the available
    free space, before  writing the file to disk.

    "Verify disk writes" - checking of file integrity
    after writing will be done

    "Copy descriptions" - the descriptions of copied
    files will be copied to descriptions containing
    file in destination directory.
    Note: this option is available only either if
    option "Always copy descriptions" in
    File Manager Setup is checked on, or if
    descriprions show mode of file panel switched on
    (or if both conditions mentioned above are true)

    "Rename to logical names" (OS/2 version only) -
    rename copied/moved files to values of their
    Extended Attribute .LONGNAME

    "Remove source files" - move files instead of copy


.topic AppendFiles=31
.title Append files

Merging files is copying two or more files to one file.
This can be done by choosing the copy command, and then enabling the
option "Append to all existing files" in the dialog box or, when
Navigator asks you if it should overwrite an existing file, you choose
the button "Append". (That question will be repeated every time an
existing file will be overwritten, if a group of files is copied.)

.topic Editor=1102
.title Text editor

Navigator's internal text-editor is intended for already existing
files, and for creating new text-files. The commands used by the
internal editor, are a little different from Word Star's commands.
The main difference consists in working with blocks of text- it is
like the editors from Microsoft Corporation(R), where it is executed
through the Clipboard.

In Navigator, more than one editor window can be opened at a time.
You can use as many windows as you want, as long as they all fit
in your computer's memory.
To exchange data between them, the same Clipboard used.

There is a small, but in the authors opinion pleasant, feature to work with
in the internal editor: if you press the right mouse button, a
line with numbers appears, that moves together with the mouse cursor within
the borders of the window.

Another feature of the editor is multilevel undo.

.title File panel
   {File panel:_} - is the main panel of the File manager. You can work with
both files and directories, and perform both individual or group operations.
You can set up each panel in {Options|Panel:_}.

   One can also set up the view of the current panel from the menu
{Panel|Select appearance preset...:_} (Alt-"-"). Or just use the hotkeys
Ctrl-(1..9,0) for {presets:PanelPresets}.
   Under Windows you can see long or short file names, and this can be changed
in the panel's view dialog (the hotkey is Ctrl-N).

   There are different file operations available. You can call them from the
{File:FileMenu} and {Panel:PanelMenu} menus.
   You can tag files for group operations with {INSERT:_} key (or SPACE key,
if you want {Options|File Manager|Setup...:FileMgrSetup}).
Untagging is made by the same keys.
   Here is more information about tagging and untagging:
   - to tag all files by mask use {Gray+:_}
   - to untag all files by mask use {Gray-:_}
   - to tag all files from the same group as the curent file use {Ctrl-Gray+:_}
   - to untag all files from the same group as the curent file use
{Ctrl-Gray-:_}
   - to tag all files with the same extension as the current file use
{Shift-Ctrl-Gray+:_}
   - to untag all files with the same extension as the current file use
{Shift-Ctrl-Gray-:_}
   - to invert tagging use {Gray*:_}. Note that directories are excluded.
   - to invert tagging including directories use {Ctrl-Gray*:_}.

   The prefix "Gray" above means that numeric pad keys are used.
   Note that you can use {Gray*:_} and {Ctrl-Gray*:_} for quick tagging of
the panel's content.
   You can also tag all if you press {Ctrl-Gray+:_} on {"..":_}.

   There are four types of file panels. These are "Drive", "List", "Archive"
and "ARVID".
   "Drive" is the main type of panels and the most commonly used. The
differences of other types will be described according to the following view.

.topic PanelSortSetup=11001
.title Sorting in file panel
{Sort by...:_}
   This block is used to choose basic sorting scheme for filenames in a panel.
(Note for Windows- and DPMI32-version users. Sorting by name sorts by that
names of the files, which are shown in the panel. So, if the panel displays
short names, sorting would be done by short names.)
   Creation date and last access date can be useful if you need to find a
file created at a certain time (it can be modified afterwards) or a file which
was accessed most recently.
   Sorting by description can be useful if you wish to find a file without
any description within a very large number of different files or to group files
with certain descriptions (showng the description can be usefull too, Ctrl-K).
   Unsorted means that names of files and directories will be shown in an
order the operating system assigns. Note that additional sorting features
(described below) are inactive, too.

{Sorting features:_}
   These features have a priority over the "Sort by..." option. Thus, if you
check "Sort by path" (i.e., for a search panel), files will be sorted by path
and only for the files with the same path the "Sort by..." option will be used.
   Sorting by group can be useful if you do not like sorting by extension and
you want to see, i.e., all documents first (*.txt, *.doc ...), then graphical
files (*.bmp, *.jpg ...) and so on.
   You can set up groups in Options->File manager->Highlight groups... and
colors for groups in Options->Colors...->File manager->File panel->Highlight->
->Custom 1, Custom 2...
   Inverted order just inverts the "Sort by..." block option. It does not
affect "Sort by path" or "Sort by group".
   If you check "Directories by name", directories will always be sorted by
their names (and "Sort by..." block option will only be used for files). This
can be useful when files are sorted by extension because directory extensions
are less important than file extensions.
   Note that this setting overrides all others in the "Sort by..." block
(except "Unsorted").

{Put to the top:_}
   Here you can set up which files should be placed first. This block has the
highest priority.
   There are four categories: "Directories", "Archives", "Executables" and
"Hidden and system". The order in the block means the order of sorting.
An additional (fifth) category, "None", can be selected when you use less than
all four categories. If so, you should select "None" for empty places.
   Here is an example of that block:

³      Put to the top:
³    1 [   Directories   ]
³    2 [    Archives     ]
³    3 [   Executables   ]
³    4 [      None       ]

   This means that first will go directories, then archives, then executables,
and then all other files. In each group files will be sorted according to
other blocks.

{File names comparing:_}
   In operating systems for which DN/2 is produced (OS/2 and Windows), the
uppercase and lowercase characters in filenames are not distinguished. So, it
is not necessary to differentiate between them when sorting files in panels.
But if you compare alphabetic characters and non-alphabetic symbols, results
of such comparsions will be different, depending on the case conversion. If
you want files starting with the "_" symbol to be before files, starting
with letter, select Lower case (and Upper case otherwise).
   Alphabetic sorting is used for national alphabets, where the machine code
comparsion results may be incorrect for national symbols.
   The possibility to mark and store individual elements is available
in this dialog.

.title Start of files on extensions

When the user is in the file panel, it would be handy if DN would start a
certain program depending on the extension of the current file. DN makes it
possible!

It is ossible to start not just one command but a complete list of
commands or to call a menu for choosing several options.
That could be done with the Extension file - the file describing how to
work with particular filetypes, determined by the extension.

To start a certain command, you just move the cursor to
the file you want, and use one of the following key combinations:
   Enter, Shift-Enter or Alt-Enter.
When you press the last combination, the menu will appear.

To describe the commands for each extension, you choose the

Options|Extension file edit menu option.
The format of each entry in the file being edited is following:

 ??? <the opening symbol>...
                          DOS command or
                          {menu description:MenuFormat} (for Alt-Enter)
                          ... <the closing symbol>

Here ??? is a particular extension, opening and closing symbols should
correspond to one of the following combinations:
     Enter - '/' and '/',
     Shift-Enter - '(' and ')'   and
     Alt-Enter - '[' and ']'

If you want to use the filename in your command, insert a '!',
name with extension - '!.!', directory of file - '!\'.
To indicate the symbol '!', use '!!'.

A fragment of the file of extensions:

DN windows are the working areas of program containing necessary information.
All sets (large enough) of DN windows is possible to separate on two large
groups: working windows and dialog boxes. The main distinction between
them is that it is possible to have several working windows of the same
type on the Desktop and to switch between them, while only one dialog box
can be active at any moment and there is no possibility to switch to
other windows when a dialog is active.

The dialog boxes are intended first of all for entering Navigator
settings, parameters of various operations such as file copying,
formatting of flexible disks or unerasing of erased files and some
other functions (for example, viewing Memo field in Database viewer).

File Manager, File Viewer and File Editor windows are examples of working
windows.

.topic Calculator=11016
.title Calculator
Calculator is intended for arithmetical calculations. Operands
can be entered in different scales of notation.
Numbers in decimal mode (DEC) are entered as usual, including
exponential form (1e-3 = 0.001). Besides, one can specify a literal
multiplier after decimal number (right up to the number, without spaces).
Russian and international multipliers' notation is allowed
('u' instead of Greek letter 'mu').
For example, 1.2ª = 1.2k = 1200; 1.2¬ª = 1.2u = 0.0000012.
'hecto' multiplier is missing, because its international notation (h)
conflicts with assembler form of hexadecimal number.
Multipliers are case-sensitive (for example, m = milli, M = mega),
other literal information in calculator is case-insensitive.

In hexadecimal mode (HEX) number begins with '$' or '0x',
or ends with 'h'. The point and the fractional part are allowed, for example,
$10.1 = 0x10.1 = 10.1h = 16.0625.
In octuple mode the number ends with 'O' or 'Q', in binary mode
it ends with 'B'. For example, 10.1o = 1000.001B = 8.125.

One can use {operations, functions:CalculatorOp} and brackets in expression.
Brackets and commas can be ommited when writing down functions.
Spaces are required to separate expression elements
consisting of letters and digits from each other.
For example, sin 1 is the correct notation, sin1 is wrong.

When the expression is written down correctly, its value
is automatically calculated and shown in large window
in all the scale notations simultaneously.
If you need to continue calculations with this result,
use the {Calculate:_} button or press <ENTER> key.

Expression result can be copied to clipboard using the {Copy:_} button.
The result will be recorded using the scale of notation
selected in the {Form:_} submenu.

If the expression contains a syntax error, the 'Error' word is displayed
in large window. If you press the {Calculate:_} button or <ENTER> key
in this state, you will see a more detailed error message,
and cursor in the input line will be moved to the position of error.

If a computational error appears during the calculation (for example,
division by zero), the name of the operator or function that caused
an error will be displayed in large window, along with the 'Error' word.
In this case you can also press the {Calculate:_} button or <ENTER> key,
and cursor in the input line will be moved to the position of the operator
that caused an error.

{Operations and functions:CalculatorOp}

.topic CalculatorOp = 50000
.title Calculator's operators and functions
{Infix operators:_} (that is being written between their operands)
are divided into 5 groups according to priority. In the range of one priority
operators are executed from left to right.

³1. Comparison operators (lowest priority)
³       = # != <> < > >= <=
³2. Adding operators
³       + - | or & and
³3. Multiplicative operators
³       * / div % mod \ >> shr << shl
³4. Exponentiation
³       ^
³5. Time (highest priority)
³       :
³(a:b = a*60+b, for example, 01:10 = 70).

{Prefix operators:_} (unary + and -, bitwise inversion ~) and all the functions
have a higher priority over any infix operator.

The functions can be written as prefix operators, i.e. without
brackets and commas. For example, log 2+1 means log(2,(+1)).
The log function in this expression is more strongly attached
to the number of two than the plus sign, therefore plus sign
loses its left operand and becomes unary.

The following {functions:_} are available (synonyms are put into brackets,
explanations are given in square brackets).

Trigonometry: SIN, COS, (TAN, TG), (COTAN, CTG), SEC, COSEC,
(ARCSIN, ASIN), (ARCCOS, ACOS), (ATAN, ARCTAN), (ACTG, ARCCOTAN),
ARCSEC, ARCCOSEC,
PI [3.1416...],
RAD [converts degrees to radians],
RADG [converts grads to radians],
DEG [converts radians to degrees],
GRAD [converts radians to grads].

Hyperbolic functions: (SH, SINH), (CH, COSH), (TH, TANH), (CTH, COTANH),
(ARCH, ARCCOSH), (ASH, ARCSINH), (ATH, ARCTANH).

Mathematics: EXP, FACT, LG, LN, LOG [log(2,8)=3], SQR [SQR(3)=9],
SQRT [SQRT(9)=3], ROOT [root(2,16)=4], ROUND, SIGN.

There is also IF function with three arguments. The result returned
is the third argument when the first is equal to zero, or the second
argument otherwise.
For example, if 3<5 log 2 8 4 = 3. The same expression can be written
as follows: if(3<5, log(2,8), 4).

Arithmetic operators are executing using the floating point using
the maximum precision provided by CPU. Bit operators are executed on
32-bit numbers (with any non-integer argument expressed in round numbers).

Comparison operators return 0xFFFFFFFF if the comparison holds true
and zero result otherwise. Such form of logical values allows to use
bitwise inverse operator (~) as logical negation. Other bitwise operators
also correctly work as logical.


.topic TempList=11017
.title Temp and Find Drive

What is the Temp Drive? Actually, this is a list of files and directories
from various directories, from various disks - information is not
copied physically, but it is only mentonied in Temp Drive.
fter that with these files is possible any operation such as Copy, Move,
View, Edit etc. Deletion from the Temp Drive does not mean deletion
file or directory from its physical location, but from the file list.

Find Drive is like Temp Drive but it places the files found on Find File
(Alt-F7). While the search of files happens, with already found and placed
in Find Drive it is already possible to work, and this list is filled up in
accordance with finding of files.

.title Advanced Search

This dialog box lets you to be extra selective about which files are
included in a File Find. It is especially important
when searching for text since you want to open, read, and
search as few large files as possible. It also makes it
possible to round up all files a certain age, size, or with a
certain {file attribute:FileAttr}.

The criteria selected is used the next time you start a search. The
Find File main dialog box shows "Advanced Search is ON" to remind
you that you are filtering the files.

Date is after: Input a file date and (optionally) time
  formatted as: mm-dd-yy [hh:mm] [AM | PM]]. For instance:
  5-10-90 or 15-1-89 7:0 am. Only files which have been
  modified after that date and time will be included in the
  search.
Date is before: Only files which were last modified before the
  input date and time will be included in the search.

Size is greater than / less than: Input a range of sizes. You
  may use K or M at the end; for instance, 2000 is about the
  same as 2K.

The check boxes let you include only files with a specific
combination of {file attributes:FileAttr}. For instance, tick the
Archive bit is set control if the file you want has been
created/modified since you last backed up.

.title User menu

Navigator allows the user to create a menu for calling external programs
and DOS-commands. It is stored in the file DN.MNU. When you call the command
Utilities|User menu, Navigator checks for this file in the current
directory, and, if it finds the file, it starts a menu from the directory,
which has the Navigator files.

Creation and editing global (i.e. accessible from any directory) user
menu is done with help of the command Options|Global menu definition. The
local menu for each directory can be edited, by choosing
Options|Local menu definition.

When the user chooses any menu command, then, if it was not the header of
the following menu level, Navigator creates a temporary .BAT file with
two parameters: First the name of the file on which the cursor was on,
and second the name of a file-list of files marked in this panel.

 {Hints:_}: þ If User menu not found in current directory, DN will
          find out User menu in upper directories.
        þ It is possible to switch between Local/Global User Menu
          while User Menu is executed.
        þ It is possible to start edit User Menu after call to it.

.title Format of the user menu file

The user menu in Navigator has a very simple structure.
Each item of this menu begins with the symbol {'>':_}, after which the level
of this item in hierarchy of menu follows.

Followed by a blank and the name of this item. In the name, it is possible

to enclose a character in {'~':_}, after pressing which, it is possible
to cause this user command without using the arrows. The following lines
contain the list of commands.

Here, {"%1":_} is the name of a file-list of files marked in active file
panel (use {"%2":_} to get file-list from passive file panel). The next
menu item begins with the symbol {'>':_}.

For creating the next menu level it is necessary to increase the number
of the level of this item with 1 in comparison with the previous and all
menu elements of this level.

.topic EnvEditor=16559
.title Edit OS Environment
;/Deleter/  Mar 2003

  You can need to edit or add new environment variables. Often you need to
change PATH or, say, BLASTER.

  In the center of the window you see all variables list, one of them is
highlighted by cursor. The variable's value is shown in the bottom line.
There you can edit this value. To add/edit/renam environment variables you
can use the buttons in the right side of the window.

WARNING: While the length of environment variable value in DN/2 is limited to
255 characters (it works for 1.51.10b11 and lower; for newer versions see
whatsnew.txt), when you press OK button, all longer variables are cut to 255
characters!

What is the background printing? The background printing is very convenient when You
want simultaneously to print some files and to engage in by other business
(editing of file, copying, viewing etc. operation in DN).

Window of background printing possible the following operations (on buttons):

 {Delete:_} - delete of file from current list
 {Close:_} - leave from regime of background printing
 {Pause:_} - pause of printing of current file. If the printer is not ready for
operation, automatically the printing is suspended.

.topic Confirmations=16563
.title Confirmations

.topic CountrySetup=16564
.title Country support
   This panel is designed for settings specific to country and language.

   The group of settings in upper part of the dialog usually does not
require manual correction. These values are requested from operating
system when DN is started for the first time.  However one can change
them if necessary.
To request this array of values from system again one can press the
button {System:_}. The uppercase table setup that existed in previous
versions of DN is eliminated now. This table is requested from operating
system and cannot be modified.

   In lower part of the dialog there are three input lines: "Keyboard",
"Alphabetic sorting", "WIN:" and "Additional codetables".

   The line {Keyboard:_} defines the name of conversion file for symbols
entered in wrong keyboard layout and is used when pressing Alt-F12
in editor and input lines. This is usual conversion file (XLT)
which is located in XLT directory by default. Setting up a full path
to a file is allowed.
For Russian layout (441) such file is supplied with DN (ru441.xlt).
If you use other layout, for example, 443 ("typewriter"), then you can
easily build the corresponding conversion file.

   The line {Alphabetic sorting:_}
specifies a weight table for alphabetic sorting of filenames in
the panels. The weight table assigns each symbol its sorting weight
and the sorting is done according to the weights, not the symbols'
codes. It's the simplest to leave this line empty or to write
there 0 - in that case the weight table for the current codepage
and current language will be used.
    In this line one can also specify the codepage number (for
current language) or name of an xlt file that translates symbols
into their weights. The file sort866.xlt defining alphabetic sorting
for Russian language is included in the distribution of DN/2.
    {Note:_}. At this time (Oct 29, 2005) all three options of
specifying alphabetic sorting are functional only in the OS/2
version of DN/2. In the Win32 version, only the xlt-file sorting
is applied.

   The line {WIN:_} defines conversion from Windows code table
to DOS code table.
In DN for DOS in this line should be the name of .xlt file.
In versions for OS/2 and Windows there can be either the name
of .xlt file or the number of code page (1251 for Russian language).
In DN for Windows there is usually '0' here. In this case the code table
for conversion from ANSI to OEM will be used; this table is requested
from operating system.
It is strongly recommended to leave this setting as is, because this
table is used when working with filenames, therefore it is important
to make sure that this table corresponds to the operating system.
   File win866r.xlt is supplied with DN, which defines reverse conversion
from CP 1251 to CP 866. This means that unconvertible symbols,
i.e. missing in target code page, are converted not to "?" as usual,
but to symbols which cannot be converted back. Besides such substitutions
are one-for-one, therefore conversion of any text is lossless.
Perhaps using this or similar table is the only case when setting
something different from zero in line WIN makes sense.

   The line {Additional codetables:_} allows to define extra code tables,
one can switch between them by pressing F8 key in editor and viewer.
Example of setting up a code table:
KOI:koi8r.xlt. Here we define a code table which will appear in window
frame as "KOI" and assigned to conversion file koi8r.xlt
(conversion from KOI8-R to CP 866).
In versions for OS/2 and Windows one can define here a code page number
instead of conversion file name. In this line several code tables
can be listed using the space symbol as separator.

   All modifications made in this dialog are applied after pressing
"{OK:_}" button if no errors will be revealed.
If "Cancel" button is pressed then the previous values for all parameters
will be used, even if "System" button was pressed before,
or if "OK" button was pressed but dialog was not closed due to revealed
errors.

.title Interface Setup

Here you can setup which elements of DN's interface you need and which you
need not.

{Clock:_} Shows clock. There are additional options for clock in file dn.ini,
section [Clock].

{Hide menu bar:_} If you hide main menu, you can access it by pressing
{F10:_}, and by left-clicking on upper line of screen. Right-clicking is used
to operate with windows. See also {Mouse overview:MouseOverview}

{Hide status line:_} This line usually contain hints for functional keys, and
other hints some time. It is located on lower line of screen.

{ESC for user screen:_} You can setup showing user screen by pressing {ESC:_},
not only {Alt-F5:_}

{Hide Command Line:_} You can hide Command Line, if you don't use it. And if
you need to execute the OS command, there is {Execute OS command:_} item in
system menu.

{Auto hide Command Line:_} If cheched, Command Line will be hidden when new
window is open, for example, editor window. Just type somehing in Manager
window, and Command Line will appear.

{Block Insert Cursor:_} Default cursor for insert is dash, and block for
replace. This option alters this behaviour.

{Store editor position:_} If checked, DN will store file position in all
edited files, so you can continue from where you stopped. Note that this
option will not work, when {Track editing history:_} is unchecked.

{Store viewer position:_} Same as previous, but for viever.

{Track editing history:_} If checked, DN will track all edited files and put
it in File Edit History. This history is available from
Utilities->File Edit History, or by hotkey Alt-PgUp.

{Track viewing history:_} Same as previous, but for viever.
Hotkey is Alt-PgDn.

{Track directories:_} Same as previous two, Hotkey is Alt-BkSp.

Block "Drive selection menu information"

This block sets the view for Drive selection menu, which is called by pressing
Alt-F1, Alt-F2, and also partly sets the view of new manager menu which is
called by pressing Ctrl-F3.

Block has two parts. Left part is a table, where you can set, what types of
information for which types of drives shold be shown. Note, that detection of
file system, volume label and free space require drive usage, so it can be
useful not to show this information for removable and optical drives.

And right is a list of additional settings.

In block of radiobuttons {For all drives; For all, except; For none:_} you
can setup showing information for all drives, for all except listed or not for
any disc correspondingly.

Semiblock "Additionally include:" has next settings

{Quick access directories:_} If checked, DN will show list of quick access
directories.

{Number of files on TEMP:_} If checked, DN will show total number of files in
TEMP: panel.

Note that this semiblock affects only menu, which is called by Alt-F1, Alt-F2
and not affect menu for creating new File Manager (Ctrl-F3)

At the most bottom is {Tabulated view:_} setting. Here is example of how it
works.

   The possibility to mark and store individual elements is available
in this dialog.

See also {File panel setup:PanelSetup}
         {Dialog box elements:DialogItems}

.topic PanelShowSetup1=16601
.title File panel setup - files in columns
{Columns block:_}
   Usually you see only the filename column. Here you can select, which
additional columns should also be displayed. For example, a path column may be
useful in the "List" panel.
   Some of the panels do not have certain columns. For example, the
"Packed size" and "Packing ratio, %" columns are meant only for archive
panels; the column "Path" is only for the "List" panels. However, this block
has all colums and all of them are available for selection. This can be
useful for storing all setups ("Store" - "All").
   The Windows and DPMI32 versions of DN also have an "Show LFN" option.
Unlike other options, it does not turn the column on (it is always on).
It sets, which type of names (long or short) should be displayed in the
"Name" column. If file system does not support short file names,
squares . will be shown as a placeholder.

   Case of names in panels {Directories, Files:_}.
   These options set the case of filenames and directory names in panels.
Options are self-explanatory, except the AUTO/auto (directories/files).
This option shows files "aS Is", if an LFN is shown in the panel and it has
both the uppercase and lowercase characters in its name or extension. But if
a panel displays short file names or if all characters in the names are of the
same case and all letters in extensions are of the same case (cases of the name
and extension may differ), then the directory names will be shown in uppercase
whereas filenames in lowercase, as in the classical DOS file managers (NC, VC).
For example, flpanel.PAS will be shown in lowercase.

   You can set up the {"Name" column width:_} and space for extension below.
The typical options are 12.3 and 18.4. If you specify 250 or more symbols
for names, then all other columns with variable width ("Path" and
"Description") will be blocked, and the name column will be the last, not the
first one. For example, for files with very long names ot may be useful to
turn on the size column, and set 252 for name width. In this case, the first
column will contain size and the second column (for all the space left) will
contain the name.

   {Tabulate extension:_} block sets the name and extension display options.
The "Tabulate" term means to show the extension from a certain position in a
line and with no separator (".") between the name and extension.
   The "Never" setting leaves 0 characters for extensions. This means that
the extension will not be tabulated and after the separator no extension will
be shown. Too long names will be truncated if they exceed the column width.
   The "Always" setting assigns certain space for extensions from the right
margin unconditionally. If a name is too long, it will be truncated before the
extension field even if the extension is short or absent. The separator "."
between name and extension will be replaced by a space character.
   The "If does not fit in" setting is similar to the "Never" setting. However,
if the full extension does not fit in, it will be truncated to certain length
(including the cut symbol). If a name together with "." do not fit into the
space before the extension, then the name will be truncated, too. The symbol
"." before the extension is shown if not changed to a cut symbol.
   The "If exists and there are symbols before" setting is a combination of
the "Always" and "Never" settings. If a file has name and extension, then it
will be shown with the "Always" setting. If a file has no extension (its full
name has no ".") or has an extension only (the only "." is the first symbol
of the name), then it will be shown as in the "Never" setting.

   Here are examples of these settings.

For example, we have these files

³Long_name
³Name
³.ext
³Long_name.ext
³Name.ext
³Name.long_ext
³.long_ext
³Long_name.long_ext
³
³12.3 setting
³
³{Never:_}     {If exists and there:_}     {If does:_}       {Always:_}
³            {are symbols before:_}   {not fit in:_}

.topic PanelShowSetup2=16602
.title File panel setup - Divider and Footer

   Here you can set up the information to show in the footer, where to show it
and how. Information types are on the left (File information, Selected files
size, ..., Free space), and on the right of each field is a selection block.
This block sets a place to show information (or skip it).

   The option "Brief on separator" is available only for "Selected files size",
"Packing % only", "Directory info", and "Free space".

Selected files size is shown in the left part of separator, whereas directory
info and free space - in its right part, and packing % - in its middle part.
Note that there is no point in selecting this option for directory info and
free space simultaneously.
   Other information spaces can not be combined. You can see only one type of
information in the line.

   If you select to show multiple info in the same line only the first type of
available information will be displayed (first in the top-bottom order in this
dialog). It may be useful to combine one or more information types which can
be absent with a type always available, but with a lower priority.
   For example, if you wish to show description and directory info in the line
3, then if the file has a description, that description will be shown,
otherwise you see directory info (files quantity and total size)
  You can have up to 4 lines in the footer. It is not nessesary to fill them
all. If a line has not been selected to display something, it will not be
shown at all. For example, if you want to have 2 lines in the footer, you can
use lines 1 and 2 or 2 and 4.

   Here is a more detailed description of the additional information in the
footer.

   {File information:_} - show in footer a line with file information. If you
select to display all information in columns, you can turn this line off.
   In Windows, where a file can have two names, the long and the short ones,
there is an additional option "Name" with two choices, "Unlike that in panel"
and "Always long". First selection shows an alternative name (if the panel
displays long names, you will see a short name here and if the panel shows
short names, you will see a long name). Second selection shows long names
always. The second choice is useful with file systems that do not support
short names.

   {Filter:_} - here you select where to show {Filter:AdvancedFilter} (mask)
of files in the panel. If there is no filtering (i.e., the mask is *.*), then
the filter will not be shown. If this line has not been selected for any other
information, it will not be shown either.
   Those who work only occasionally with filters can select to show them in
the line 1 and all other information in the line 2 and below. Usually, the
filter will be absent, the line 1 will not be shown and what you set up for
the line 2 will be displayed right under the divider. But if you select any
filter, the line 1 will appear and the divider will expand up by one line.

   {LFN:_} - here you select where to show long file name for the current
file. It is displayed in full width of the panel. If you select to show
long names, the next four options define their format.
   {Place:_} ["At left side";"Centered";"At right side"] - these options
indicate where in the line names that are shorter than the panel width will
be shown.

   {Show:_} ["Left part and ext."; "Right part"; "Left part"] - here you select
what to show and what to cut, if name is long and does not fit into the panel
width. "Left part" shows names with as much symbols as possible at their
beginnings. "Right part" shows names with as much symbols as possible at their
ends. "Left part and extension" gives priority to extensions and uses all
remaining space for names.
Here is an example. Assume that we have the following file:
This_is_a_file_with_a_very_long_name_and_with_extension.extension

³"Left part and ext."  This_is_a_file_with_a_very_lextension
³
³"Left part"           This_is_a_file_with_a_very_long_name_
³
³"Right part"          ong_name_and_with_extension.extension

   "Show" - {If not fully shown anywhere:_}". If you select this option, long
filename in the footer will be displayed only if it is not shown fully in the
panel or in the line with file information.

   {Common part:_} ["Do not highlight";"Highlight";"Do not show"]. This option
defines how common parts of filenames are shown, how they are displayed in the
panel and in the footer. When name is cut in both places and cutting is
different, it may be useful to clearly see differences.
   If you select "Do not highlight", then the common part will be different
from the other part.
   If you select "Highlight", the common part will be shown in one color,
whereas the other part will be shown in a different color. These colors are the
same colors as for text and numbers in the line with selected files info.
   Common part is searched for name (from the beginning until first difference)
and for extension (similarly) separately, so the name in the footer can have
two highlighted zones. The comparison is case-insensitive.
   If you select "Do not show" - the common part will not be shown. This
option cuts only one common part from the beginning. This option may be useful
for searching long names that differ from short names: the footer for 8.3 names
will be empty (all name is the common part), and for really long names the
footer will show something.

   At the very bottom of the dialog is the {"Misc. options:_}" block
affecting not only the footer, but also the panel itself.
   [X] Zoomed panel makes the panel maximized
over the entire window horizontally. This regime may be useful for showing
many columns or very long columns ("Name", "Description").
   [X] Column titles - When turned on, the column titles will be displayed
(Name, Directory, Size, etc.).

.topic SavePanelSetup=16581
.title Save panel settings

   This dialog can be used to store certain groups of settings (those where
the "Store" button is pressed) in selected places.
   By defult settings are stored in {numbered block of settings:PanelPresets}
which is last loaded to this panel. Type of the panel in the storage dialog
is the same as the current panel type.
   The panel type is selected in the left selection block and where to store
is in the right marking block. You can store (both panels) to any numbered
block of settings (they have numbers).
   If you select "All" for "Panel type", all settings from the dialog will be
saved for all four {types:PanelView} panel types.
   If you select certain type in "Panel type", you will see a very brief info
about the view settings ("Name" field width, number of symbols for extension,
and also some other information ocassionally) in "Block of settings" for all
numbered sets. So, you can more easily differentiate the presets. If you
select "All" for "Panel type", then any information will not be shown, because
in one preset it can be different for different panel types.
   Very often you need to store your preferences (for example, sorting that is
different from the default) in all presets and in both panels. In that case,
you can press the {Check all:_} button to check all addresses. A second stroke
of the button would leave only the current preset marked.

   For example, suppose that you want both panels and the preset 4 to always
have sorting by name for all panel types. So, call the sorting dialog (Alt-S),
select sorting by name (and other settings, if needed). Then press the "Store"
button, select "All" in the left block, and mark "4", "Current panel" and
"Opposite panel". When you press "OK", all settings will be stored to all
marked places. The easiest way to close the sorting dialog is to press the Esc
key since settings for the current panel are alredy stored.

.topic PanelSetup=16582
.title File panel settings
   All the file panel settings are divided into three groups and each group
has its own dialog. These are the settings for {view:PanelShowSetup},
{sorting:PanelSortSetup} and {filter:AdvancedFilter}.
   All these settings can be turned on and off separately. Common settings
are controlled in the {file manager:FileMgrSetup} dialog.
   Here are described common properties for all three dialogs, while specific
issues are discussed in respective articles.
   When the dialog is called, its elements are filled in according to the
current panel settings. These elements can be configured in some way and then
you press "OK" button to accept changes and close the dialog.
   The changes are made only for the current panel and only for the current
panel type. For example, if you change the sorting type for the disk panel and
then perform a search, the sorting changes will not be used in the search
panel. But when you return to the disk panel, you will have your sorting
preferences back. Note that all such changes are active only within the current
session of work with DN. After the restart of DN, they will be lost. If you
want to save them, you should turn "Autosave Desktop" on or store them
manually through the "Save desktop" menu item.

   DN preserves 10 separate {presets:PanelPresets} of settings. If you press
Ctrl-number in a settings dialog, the corresponding preset will be loaded
in the dialog. Then press {"Store":SavePanelSetup} button and the settings
will be stored in the same preset (if you load preset [5], that preset [5]
will be saved).

   Sometimes it is desirable to store not all items shown in settings dialog,
but just some of them, and often one needs to store them in several places
at once. For exanple, if you initially had set case filter for all presets
working in such way, that directories are shown in upper case and files in
lower one, and suddenly you would decide to change it to "aS Is", but you
want to keep all another settings for panels.
   In such cases it is enough to mark those dialog item, which you would like
to store (i.e. to change), and all another items will be kept without changes.
If there is no marked items, then the data from dialog will be stored
completely. Marking is valid both for saving settings for current panel
by "OK" button and for storing in different places (i.e. presets) by pressing
"Store" button.
   Marking could be done by clicking on the item label by the right mouse
button or by pressing Ctrl-S hotkey on the current item (you need to make
current the item which you desire to mark before marking by Tab key or
hotkey). Marked item will have a rectangular mark at left side of its label.
If you will make right mouse button or press Ctrl-S again on the item already
marked, then it will be unmarked.
   There is also Ctrl-A hotkey, allowing to select all items in dialog
(if there was no items selected) or to unselect all selected items (if
there was at least one item selected). It can be useful if you like to store
all settings except some ones. In this case you can select all items by
Ctrl-A and then unselect some of them by Strl-S.

.topic PanelPresets=16596
.title Numbered presets
   Full settings preset includes settings for the four types of panel (Disk,
Archive, List, ARVID) and in each type there are three groups of settings:
{appearance:PanelShowSetup}, {sorting:PanelSortSetup}, and
{filter:AdvancedFilter}. Each panel has its own preset.

   DN allows you to store 10 presets independently from the curret panel
settings. These presets are numbered by 1, 2,..., 8, 9, 0. Settings from a
numbered preset can be loaded into certain panel, and the panel settings can
be stored to a numbered preset.

   The settings of the panel could be loaded from preset (or from another
panel) in various scope. You can perform either complete loading of all
settings of a preset, or just load panel appearance settings for all panel
types, and also you can load the concrete group of settings for the concrete
type of panel (for example, one can load only sorting for the List panel).

   Complete loading of all settings of a preset or loading of panel
appearance settings both could be done via the menu of preset loading (called
with {Alt-"-":_}). For more detailed information see:
{Select panel settings preset:SelectPreset}.
   Another way to load appearance settings is to press {Ctrl-number:_} hotkey
with number of desired preset (or {Ctrl-=:_} to load appearance settings from
opposite panel). There is optional possibility to load with Ctrl-number
not only appearance settings, but also complete set of all settings of a
preset. For more detailed information see:
{Select panel settings preset:SelectPreset}.

   When you load an appearance settings, the previous settings will be saved.
If you want to undo the settings, you can press Ctrl-"-" or select a point to
restore from the Alt-"-" menu. This is useful for temporary settings. For
example, preset 2 has settings for the most detailed view. If you got use to
work without such view and you want to call it for a while, you simply could
press Ctrl-2. Later when you want to turn your previous settings back,
press Ctrl-"-".

   When trying to load appearance preset identical to current by number
and contents (which has no sense) with hot key or Alt-minus menu,
the preset menu is called, like on Alt-minus. This behavious can be changed
by setting MenuOnError=0 in dn.ini. In this case the second loading
of already loaded preset is simply ignored.

   Loading of certain groups of settings for a certain panel type could be
done in the panel settings dialog. For example, to load sorting preferences
for the list panel from the preset number 6, you should open any list panel
(for instance, go to TEMP:), call the {sorting dialog:PanelSortSetup} and
press Ctrl-6. Loaded settings will be shown in the dialog items. To store
them in the panel settings just press "OK" button.

   There is no way of editing the numbered presets directly. There is no way
to look at all presets and even one preset too, because even one preset has
too many options to show on the screen simultaneously. To edit presets
you should use the panel settings dialogs. Just load the corresponding part
in a dialog by pressing Ctrl-digit, edit it, and store by pressing the
{"Store":SavePanelSetup} button.

.topic AdvancedFilter=48029
.title File panel filter
   This dialog allows you to set {filter:Wildcards} of names in current panel.
You will see only those files that match filtering criteria.
   Current filter (usually '*.*') is shown in the upper part of window. In
the line you can enter any filter manually or select from history any
previously entered filter.
   Below the current filter is a quick builder for extension filter. You can
select one or more extensions (press space to tag them) and press "Show" or
"Hide" buttons to add or hide such files.

Input the name of directory you want to create. The name must be a

If you don't specify the full path, the directory will be created in the
current directory. In fact, you can create full directory inherinatce
(for example if you enter 'Dir1\Dir2\Dir3...', Navigator will create
directory Dir1, Dir2 as subdirectory of Dir2 etc.)

It is also possible to create several directories in different places of
your system. You should use semicolon to do that. For example, if you enter
'Dir1;Dir2;D:\Dir3', Navigator will create directories Dir1 and Dir2 in the
current directory and Dir3 - in the root directory of D: drive.

.topic SortBy=48018
.title Sort files in panel by...
 In this menu you can change the criterion of files sorting in the panel.
If the item "Unsorted" was choosen, then the order of files will be the
same as in the listing of directory content by {DIR:_} command line
command.
 Also you can set additional sorting features: sort by path, by group,
inverted order and sorting of directories always by name (more detailed
description of sortin modes see in help chapter for dialog of sorting
options {Sorting in file panel :PanelSortSetup}).
 When the criterion of files sorting was choosen through this menu, the
changes will be set for all panel types by default (unlike the dialog of
sorting options). Thus, if yo had set some sort mode in Drive panel, you
will get the same sort mode in the File Find, Archive panels etc. However,
the possibility to change the files sorting criterion only for current panel
type still exists. For this purpose you have to press either {Shift-Enter:_}
or {Right arrow:_} on desired menu item or make mouse click on the
submenu opening symbol enclosed in square brackets: {[]:_}. In this case the
submenu will be opened allowing to choose between changing of sort mode for
current panel type only or for
all panel types:

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ³All panel types    ³
 ³ Current panel type ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 The item marked by diamond symbol in this submenu is the default action
for items of the basic Files Sort menu. You can change the default value
by choosing of another menu item and pressing Space bar on it. As soon as it
was done the choosing of file sorting from the basic menu will always change
the sort mode only for current panel type. Such behaviour will be kept for
following DN launching. If you like to bring back an old behaviour, you need
to call this submenu again, choose the item "All panel types" and press
the Space bar. Of course, this submenu allows to perform action different
from default one just for one time, without storing it anywhere: you need
just choose the desired menu item and press Enter.

.topic Extract=48030
.title Extract files from archive
Enter the target {directory:_} for extract. If the directory does not exist,
it will be created automatically.

Options:

{Extract with path names:_}: extract files from archive with keeping
                          the structure of directories stored in
                          archive

{Test only:_}: Test files integrity in archive without extracting

{Force mode:_}: Extract without archiver's requests of confirmations
             to any actions (such as files overwriting)

{Through temporary directory:_}: Extract files to temporary
                subdirectory in destination directory and move
                them to destionation directory.
                The benefits of this method are:
                 - The standard file overvrite confirmation dialogs
                   will be shown with possibility to rename new file
                   or append it to old file
                 - Files will be extracted from subdirectories in
                   archive with directories structure creation from
                   current path inside archive, but not from archive
                   root, even in case if it is impossible to do by
                   mean of archiver itself
                This option has no effect in cases when it is
                obsolete, i.e. if extration to empty or non-existing
                directory from archive root (or from any directory
                in archive of type with non-empty "Set path inside"
                archiver setting) takes place

 Set {Password:_} if archive is password-protected

.title File manager setup

{"Behavior" block:_}

   {[X] Auto change directory:_} - When checked, if one panel is a directory
tree and another is a "Disk", then moving in the tree will cause directory to
change in another panel. Otherwise directories will be changed only when you
press Enter on a tree element.
   {[X] Drag-and-drop:_} - You can work with files using mouse.
See article {Working with mouse:MouseOverview}.
   {[X] Beep after copy:_} - DN will beep after copying, if the process took
more than 30 seconds.
   {[X] ENTER opens archive:_} - By default, opening an archive as a
directory is done by F3 or Ctrl-PageDown on the archive name. When this
option is turned on, you can open archives by pressing Enter. Note that
this prevents executing self-extracting archives by pressing Enter. To execute
such archives you should type archive name on the command line directly
(or use Ctrl-Enter or Ctrl-Shift-Enter to paste names there). Also you cannot
execute commands assigned to the Enter key in dn.ext (but commands assigned to
Shift-Enter can be executed).

   {[X] SPACE toggles selection:_} - By default, file tagging is done by
pressing the Ins key. This setting allows you to tag files with Spacebar,
provided that the command line is empty.

   {[X] DEL erases file(s):_} - By default, deleting files is done by pressing
the F8 key. Turning this setting on allows you to delete files with the Del
key, if the command line is empty.

   {[X] Use / keys:_} - When this option is turned on and the command line
empty, the cursor moving keys / are used in file panel. When turned off,
these keys are used to move the cursor in the comand line. If you turn this
on and want to move the cursor in a non-empty command line, just press Shift
when using the / keys.

   {[X] Alt difference:_} - With this option turned on, when you press
Alt-digit, you will go to a quick access directory in the left panel, if the
left Alt is used and in the right panel, if the right Alt is used. When this
option if off, Alt-digit changes directory in the current panel.

   {[X] BS - go to upper directory:_} - If you have empty command line, then
you go to parent directory by pressig BackSpace key. To prevent unwanted
directory changes when you are erasing command line using the key, there is
some delay before this feature is activated.

   {[X] Do not kill descriptions:_} - When you delete files, their
descriptions will not be deleted.

   {[X] Kill description containers:_} - If you delete all files with
descriptions in a directory, then description file will be deleted too.

   {[X] Always copy descriptions:_} - Description will always be copied
when a file is copied, not only when you turn on the option of showing
descriptions in the panel.

   {[X] Drive line autorefresh:_} - When turned on, the drive line will
be automatically refreshed every 3 seconds. It may be useful when you
mount and unmount drives. Note that devices will not be physically
accessed during the refreshes.

   {[X] Panel autorefresh:_} - When turned on, DN will track changes in
the file system and refresh file panels, when necessary.

   {[X] Desriptions by Short names:_} - When turned on, descriptions will be
assigned short (alternative) file names. Otherwise, descriptions will be
assigned long (standard) file names.

   {Quick search:_} - Selects the quick search key. There are 2 variants:
"Single Alt" and "Single Ctrl". "Single Alt" means, that you need to press and
release Alt key to activate quick search and then type file name you want to
be found. "Single Ctrl" acts the same way, but you have to use the Ctrl key
instead of the Alt key.
   DN uses Alt and Ctrl in hotkeys, so there are no quick search regimes with
holding this keys.
   Option "Caps+symbol", which was available in the DOS version of DN is
absent in DN/2, because it causes an unwanted CapsLock regime.

   {[X] L/R Ctrl in drive line:_} - This setting gives an option of changing
drives in the drive line with Ctrl- and Ctrl-
 keys. There are three options:
"Active panel always" (left and right Ctrl do not differ and both are used to
change drives in the active panel), "Passive/active panel" (the left Ctrl is
used to change drives in the passive panel, and the right Ctrl - in the active
one) and "Left/right panel" (the left Ctrl changes drives in the left panel,
and the right Ctrl - in the right one).

{"Display" block:_}

These are the elements that are shown in file panels

   {[X] Sort type indicator:_} - When turned on, at the left top corner
of the panel sorting scheme indicator will be displayed.

   {[X] Drive line:_} - When turned on, the drive line will be shown at the
bottom of the panel. Then you can quickly select disks with Ctrl-/
, or by
pressing the mouse button when pointer is on a drive letter.

   {[X] Scrollbar:_} - When turned on, scrollbar will be shown in file panels.

   {[X] Files highlight:_} - When turned on, files will be highlighted. You
can setup highlighting in Options->Colors...->File Manager->File Panel->
->Highlight, and highlight groups in Options->File Manager->Highlight groups.

   {[X] Show hidden files:_} - When turned on, you will see files with the
"Hidden" attribute. This option also affects file searchig and open and save
file dialogs.

   {Tag char:_} - Symbol to tag selected files. If you delete or change this
symbol to Space character, selected files will be tagged with color only.

   {Cut char:_} - Symbol to tag name part or extension of a file, if it cannot
be fully shown because of insufficient space.
   Cut char affects not only file panels, but also the footer (including the
description cut), and also the "Filter" window.

   {Files with descriptions:_} - File names, where descriptions are stored.
You can set multiple names (separate names with semicolon), for example:

  descript.ion;files.bbs

The directory will be scanned for a file with the first name, then the second
name, then the third name, and so on.

   {New Manager preset:_} - When a new manager is opened, {preset:PanelPresets}
with a selected number will be used for its panels.

   {Left panel:_} - Here you select the left panel type for a new manager. The
right panel type is always "Drive".

 ³ Viewing and editing Û
 ³ files by extensions Û
 ÀÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÛ

When the user is in file panel, he may occasionally need to view/edit
a file by an external editor or a viewer. The possiblity to do it is
well-realized in Navigator.
For it, the files of extensions are used (for viewer - dn.vwr, for editor -
dn.edt).

This file describes work with particular file type, determined by extension.
To view/edit a file, you need to set the cursor on the file panel to the name
of the file, then for viewing press F3 and for editing press F4 (or Alt-F3
and Alt-F4 correspondingly, if Options|Defaults|{Configuration...:Configuration}
Internal editor is set to on).
If the above option is not set, to use the internal viewer/editor on such
file, press Alt-F3 or Alt-F4, correspondingly.
However, it is possible to specify an alternative viewer in the dnalt.vwr
file. Then the internal viewer can be called by Shift-Alt-F3 combination.

For the viewers description, call Options|Viewers.

For the editors description, call Options|Editors.

The format of a record in this file is such:

 ???:command_name

Here {???:_} is the extension
     {Command_name:_} is name of the program for viewing or editing

When viewing, it is possible to use filter programs - for example, to view
files which are by default not viewable with the internal viewer.
To perform it, !%F macro is used, that means the file into which the
filter program should write the file processing result.

Example:

doc:c:\programs\AntiWord\antiword.cmd !.! !%F

In this case, when trying to view a file with .doc extension, the antiword.cmd
file will be run, and it will have to read the file substituting "!.!"
(arranged by the Navigator), process it, and write into the file
substituting "!%F". After viewing, the !%F file will be deleted.

.topic Wildcards=48058
.title Wildcards and Filters.

   Filename in DOS has two parts: name and extension. Name shoud be eight
symbols or less, and extension - three sybols or less. Name and extension is
separatedby a point, for example "filename.ext"

   In OS/2 and Windows file name can be 254 symbols long and contain any
number of points (but not in the end of filename). However, the sequence after
the last point is called extension, and used to determine file type.
   If filename has no points, it asuumed that it has point at the end.

   Wildcard is a sequence of symbols, which can contain not only common
symbols (they mean themselves), but also a 'jocker' symbols (they mean
different symbols in file name). Operation systems support two 'jockers'

   * - it means any number of symbols (or none symbols)
   ? - it means any one symbol (or none)

   DN has additional 'jockers':

   > - it means any symbols (or none) till last point including.
   | - means one digit

   In addition, '?' means only one symbol (it can't be none)

   For example, we have a '*a>t*' wildcard. Files advance.txt, readme.txt suit
it, and file a.txt don't.

   In many cases, Dos Navigator allow you to use not only one wildcard, but
a certain combination of it. Wildcards is separated by ";" symbol. Such
combinations is called {filters:_}.
   Filename suits filter, if it suits at least one wildcard in it.


³Example:   *.exe;*.com;*.bat;*.btm;*.cmd  Ä¿
³           *.asm;*.c;*.cpp;*.inc;*.pas    ÄÅ- This is a filters
³           name.*; *.exe                  ÄÙ

In first case, all files with 'exe' 'áom' 'bat' 'btm' and 'cmd' extesions will
be processed. In second - with 'asm' 'c' 'cpp' 'inc' and 'pas extensions. In
third - files with 'name' name and any extension, and files with any name, but
'exe' extension.

   If you want to exclude some files from processing, you can enter them in
filter with minus ("-") symbol. In this case all files will be processed
except files, suiting wildcard with "-".

³Example:  *.*; -*.txt; -text.*
³          *.com; -command.com
³          *.pas; *.c; -my*

In firs case all files will be processed, except suiting '*.txt' and 'text.*'
wildcards. In second - all '*.com' files except 'command.com'. In third - all
'*.pas' and '*.c' files except the ones, starting with 'my'.

.topic CustomVideo=48059
.title Customized Video modes

DOS Navigator supports not only standard text modes. It is possible to use
Super EGA, VGA and VESA BIOS extensions. If you want to use it,
put in System configuration dialog box "Video mode 1" and "Video mode 2" codes
of desired video modes. This codes must be described in technical documentation
of your Video system.

  Some of codes is known to me:
           29 (132x25),30 (132x60) - Realtek VGA cards
           84,85,86                - Trident VGA cards
           35 (132x25)             - ATI VGA cards
           80,81,82                - OAK Technology VGA cards
                         and most of Super EGA/VGA cards.

If your video system is VESA compatible, you can use universal VESA mode codes
(note that VESA XGA and VESA SVGA has different mode codes). These codes is
greater than 256. For VESA SVGA codes are 109 or 110, for example.

 {Note:_}: Most of mouse drivers doesn't support extended
        video modes. Therefore you must switch off
        "Standard cursor" option in {Mouse setup:MouseSetup} dialog box
        if you get any ugly effects when moving mouse cursor
        in non-standard video modes.

 {Hint:_}: For VGA adapters mode number 256 means mode 80x33.

.topic OS2Support=48060
.title OS/2 Support

NB: OS/2 is a registered trademark of IBM Corp.

DOS Navigator can start OS/2 applications when it works under OS/2 version
2.10 or later.

To get this possibility under OS/2 version 2.1x you should set OS2COMSPEC
environment variable to full name of OS/2 command interpreter
(e.g. put
    SET OS2COMSPEC = C:\OS2\CMD.EXE
 in DOS session autoexec.bat)
Under OS/2 Warp 3 or later it's only necessary if location of OS/2 command
interpreter is different than <bootdrive>:\os2\cmd.exe

 There are three ways to run OS/2 applications:

   þ From DOS command line:

     Put before command string one of chars listed below:
         ">" - run foreground Full Screen OS/2 session
         "<" - run background Full Screen OS/2 session
         "]" - run foreground Windowed OS/2 session
         "[" - run background Windowed OS/2 session
   þ Switch to OS/2 command prompt mode by {Alt-/:_}
   þ Run executable files from file panel:

     highlight required file and press
        - Alt-Shift-Enter to run it foreground
        - Alt-Ctrl-Enter to run background.

     NB: in OS/2 command prompt mode all programs
         include DOS applications  starts in another
         sessions. Be sure that parameters for DOS
         sessions are acceptable for your applications.

 {Hints:_}: þ if Files Highlight option is enabled
          OS/2 batch files (*.CMD) are shown as executable
          files. You can start it as usual .EXE files by
          pressing Enter. If you'll press Shift-Enter,
          batch will be started in background.

.topic FilesBBS=48061
.title 4DOS/Files.BBS support

 Yes, DOS Navigator supports it!

It is possible by setting up Panel|Setup Columns - just set
"Descriptions" checkbox on. Not only view descriptions is possible, but
copying, moving and editing too!

Copy/move file with its descriptions is possible only when descriptions are
present in file panel.

If you want to edit file description (by {Alt-INS:_} key), but file with
descriptions doesn't exists, Navigator will create file with first file name
given in "Files with descriptions" line of File Panel Defaults dialog box.

.topic NavyLink=48063
.title Navigator Link

Navigator Link allows to access remote computer by a common file {panel:LinkPanel}. The
following features are implemented: Create/Remove directories, Copy, View and
Erase files. Navigator Link uses its own communication protocol, developed by
RIT.

Advantages:

{- block streaming mode:_}

Navigator Link works seamlessly in {server/slave:LinkStatusWnd} mode and doesn't take full
CPU time during link session. It is also possible to work fine via packet
transport protocols (ipx/spx, tcp/ip) and other hardware (parrallel port) via
FOSSIL interface.

{- bi-directional mode and true full duplex:_}

Both machines linked by DN have equal rights on each other's drives, and both
can work with remote simultaneously.

{- advanced errror correction:_}

Navigator Link uses double-level selective reject method, so it works even on
high-noise lines.

{- real-time data compression:_}

Link allows to transfer text files and directory data twice faster on the
same line. The compression works more efficient than modems' internal
compression methods.

.title FTN File Attach Feature

DN has the ability to attach files to be sent with FTN networking software
using a Binkley-style outbound. To use this feature, the following information
should be appended to the Files with descriptions field in the File Manager
Setup dialog:

;/fido=<address>,<outbound>

Here <address> is your FTN address in your primary zone, written in 3D or 4D
form, and the <outbound> is your primary zone outbound directory specification.
Outbound directories for secondary zones are created and used with Portal Of
Power style names (with hexadecimal zone numbers as extensions). Outbound
subdirectories for points are handled correctly.

After that, for attaching select one or more files and press Alt-L for the Make
List File dialog. Enter either "%", "+", or "/" followed by the 3D or 4D
destination address instead of the list file name. "%" means Normal flavor, "+"
means Crash, and "/" is for Hold. Leave the Action field empty for the normal
send mode, enter ###:#\#.# there for the file to be tuncated after sending
(substitute ##!:!\!.! if your FTN software does not support long file names) or
enter ^#:#\#.# to have the file killed after sending (^!:!\!.! for short names
only).

.topic ZIPWithoutCentralDir=22000
.title ZIP archive without central directory

 All ZIP-archives must have special data block called central directory at
the end of archive file. It is impossible to extract any files from archive
without central directory. Current archive has no central directory (possibly,
because of uncompleted download of archive file). The viewing of current
archive contents is possible, but reparing of archive is necessary to extract
files. The original archive file will be kept unchanged, and new repared
file with new name will be created, usually "pkfixed.zip".
 No corrupted data will be recovered after such reparation, but all intact
data will be accessible for extracting.
 This operation is not integrated into DN/2 and must be performed manually.

 In case you are using {pkzip 2.5:_} for OS/2 or Win32, please enter such
command in command line:

pkzip /fix <archive name>

 or just try extract something from archive - archiver will prompt for
automatical archive reparing.

 In case you are using {pkzip / pkunzip:_} version 2.0x for OS/2 or version
up to 2.5 for DOS, please use PKZIPFIX utility to repare archive. Using of
earlier versions of PKZIPFIX for DOS in not recommended because it can cause
long names corruption.

 If you are using Infozip {unzip / zip:_}, please enter such
command in command line:

 zip -f <archive name>.

.topic SkipBadFile=49009   {John_SW}
.title Could not open the file

.topic QueryAbort=49010
   If copying of a file is canceled by the user or by read errors, then
(by default) the part of the file that has been copied is deleted.
However, one can set on corresponding options in the cancel dialog,
and the initial part of the file will be saved with its actual length
(that has been written). The time and attributes of the partial file
will be those of the source file.
   One can resume copying of the file by setting an option "Resume"
in the copy dialog or by pressing the "Resume" button in the dialog of the
choice of action when the target name exists.
   When resuming copying files, the initial part of the source file
(with the length of the target file) is skipped and its remaining part
is read and written to the end of the target file. There is no checking
by DN of the content of the initial part of the source file and the
target file, i.e. it is the user's responsibility to ensure that the
target file is in fact the partial copy of the source file, and not
just another file with the same name. DN checks only file lengths and
the resumption of copying is possible only when the target file is
smaller than the source file.
   If "Resume" is done automatically and the target file is not smaller
than the source file, then this operation is equivalent to the "Skip".
For example, if you were copying a directory and interrupted the copy
operation while keeping the partially written file, then you can
continue copying of the directory using "Resume": all files that had
been fully copied will be skipped, the partially copied file will be
copied completely, and the remaining files will be copied as expected.

.topic QuickSearch=01210
.title Quick search
   Quick search is used for quick cursor positioning on a certain file in
current directory. Classic quick search (as in NC and VC) imply, that you
enter file name gradually, from the first letter, and, while you enter, cursor
moves to a nearest file, which name begins with the sequence you entered.
Cursor can move only forward, and if forward search fails to find appropriate
file, search will continue from the beginning of the list. If a letter you
entered is a symbol of a current file name, cursor will remain on his place.
In most file managers not only cursor move, but in addition, entered sequence
is shown somewhere.
   Quick search in DN/2 has much more potential, because you enter not just a
sequence of first letters, but a {mask:Wildcards} with a '*' assumed at
the end of sequence. So, there is no hard, symbol-by-symbol compare of a first
letters, but a checking of filename to suit entered mask. When you begin a
quick search, mask is only an assumed '*', and all files suit it, so,
whatever the current file is, the cursor will not move. Entered symbols are
placed before '*' so, if you enter only common symbols, quick search will work
as it was in NC and VC. The mask you enter will be shown in footer or divider.
In addition, in current file name the text cursor will be shown. This cursor
show the place, where the comparsion is for now (assumed '*' in the end is not
included).

   You can enter any {wildcards:Wildcards} in a quick search mask.
For example you want to quickly set cursor on 'Program Files'. You enter
'p* f', and cursor sets on a nearest name, with 'p' at the beginning and
contain space symbol, followed by 'f'.

   You can stop entering mask anytime and cycle files, suiting it by pressing
Ctrl-Enter. Note, that quick search is not cancelled by Ctrl-Enter, so you can
continue entering the mask.

   If you use sorting by extension, you shoud pay attention to a '>' symbol in
mask. It substitute all symbols to last point including. For example you have
a directiory, containing files with different extensions. And you want to move
to files with 'txt' extension. So, you activate a quick search and enter
'>txt'. But usually only '>t' is quite enough. If you want to continue quick
search by the name of file, you can clear the mask by pressing BackSpaáe and
start entering a name.

.topic SelectPreset=48104
.title Select panel settings preset
  This menu allows to load {panel settings preset:PanelPresets} for the
current file panel.
  By default only panel appearance settings will be loaded through this menu.
To perform complete loading of preset settings one have to choose desired
menu item and press either {Shift-Enter:_} or {Right arrow:_} on it, or make
mouse click on the submenu opening symbol enclosed in square brackets:
{[]:_}. In this case the submenu will be opened allowing to choose between
loading of appearance settings only or loading of complete set of settings
from chosen preset (including {appearance:PanelShowSetup},
{sorting:PanelSortSetup}, and {filter:AdvancedFilter} settings):

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ³Appearance only  ³
 ³ Full panel setup ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

  The item marked by diamond symbol in this submenu is the default action
for items of the basic Select Panel Settings Preset menu. You can change the
default value by choosing of another submenu item and pressing Space bar on
it. As soon as it was done the choosing of certain preset loading from the
basic menu will always load the complete set of settings from this preset.
Such behaviour will be kept for following DN launching. If you like to bring
back an old behaviour, you need to call this submenu again, choose the item
"Appearance only" and press the Space bar. Of course, this submenu allows to
perform action different from default one just for one time, without storing
it anywhere: you need just choose the desired submenu item and press Enter.
  Changing of default action for basic menu items through this submenu also
changes the action of {Ctrl-number:_} hotkeys responsible for quick preset
loading. By default pressing of these hotkeys causes loading of appearance
settings set, however after changing of default action for items of the
basic Select Panel Settings Preset menu to the complete preset loading, the
{Ctrl-number:_} pressing also will cause complete loading of the preset.

.topic DialogItems=48105
.title Dialog box elements

   Dialog box opens, if dots pl.(...) is indicated after a menu command. The
dialog box grants a convenient method of viewing of the information and
setting of parameters.
   Dialog box contains a number of items, allowing to set certain kind of
settings. Most of these items have a labels, which change color when the
item becomes active.
   To use the keyboard for an element activisation it is possible to press
the letter highlighted in this element's label together with {Alt:_}.
   Pressing of {Tab:_} or {Shift-Tab:_} results in moving in a dialog box
forward or backward from one managing element to another. When the element
becomes active, it is highlighted.
